# Validation Results

No UiPath Labs validation has been run yet.

Use [VALIDATION_GATES.md](VALIDATION_GATES.md) for pass/fail criteria.

Until hard gates G-001 through G-004 are answered, the data model and UiPath integration map remain provisional.

## 2026-06-18 - Local Provisional Core Baseline

Environment:

- Local Python 3.9.12.
- No UiPath Labs tenant or Maestro Case surface used.

Steps:

1. Installed local package with `python -m pip install .`.
2. Ran unit tests with `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
3. Ran eval baseline with `python -m service_recovery_core.evals --output eval_results/local_baseline.json`.

Observed:

- Package build/install completed.
- Unit suite ran 16 tests.
- Eval suite ran E-001 through E-009 with 9/9 passing.
- E-009 persisted the raw agent recommendation and policy decision as separate linked events.

Result:

- PASS for local/provisional validation only.
- Not a UiPath Labs validation result.

Decision impact:

- Waves 07-14 are stable enough for local development.
- Wave 22 baseline is stable enough as a portable harness pending Test Cloud mapping.

Follow-up:

- Run G-001 through G-004 when Labs access is available.
- Map local eval scenarios to UiPath/Test Cloud only after platform assumptions are verified.
